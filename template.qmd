## Template Overview {.mst}

**Template Purpose**

The goal of this document is to provide a helpful, easily editable template for UBC students, staff, and faculty. Several presentation slide classes are available.

This is an example of a `.mst` (Main Slide Type) class slide. Code can be visually represented using backticks: ``.

**How to Edit**

This template is a Quarto presentation. It should be edited through RStudio.

I would strongly recommend using `editor: source` rather than `editor: visual`. Managing classes becomes very clunky in RStudio's visual editor.

## Roadmap {.mst}

This is another example of a `.mst` class slide. Since the `.qmd` document is all Markdown (with some HTML to help with style!), slides can be edited quickly.

Lists can be made with `- Element` or `1. Element`. 

Subheading font can be designated with `**Subheader**`. 

To make the blue section dividers, use `<div class = "break"><br></div>`.

**Ordered List**

1. Element 1
2. Element 2

<div class = "break"><br></div>

**Unordered List**

- Element 1
- Element 2

# Subsection 1 {.subsection1}

<div class="subsection-title">
Subsection 1
</div>

# Thank you! {.cst}

This is an example of a `.cst` (Centered Slide Type) class slide.

<div class = "break"><br></div>

I appreciate your interest in this template.
